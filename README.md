# Research-Overflow-Study



## About
This repository contains the python script for "Image super resolution of Human face images using GAN". It is primarily intended as a study of the research workflow rather than as a final, production-level implementation. Therefore, the model architecture is kept simple (a "dummy" setup) to facilitate the research process. As such, the test results might rely heavily on the ResNet backbone, and the conclusions drawn are for educational purposes.

## Note
This repository is made public as of November 4, 2023. The associated paper is written as a research study rather than for formal publication.
